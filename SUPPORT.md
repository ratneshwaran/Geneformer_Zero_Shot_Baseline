## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing 
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues, file your bug, ask a question 
or request a feature as a new Issue.

If you face an issue with installation or running the code, on top of the error message please describe 
your enviornment well (what operating system do you use, if you use conda or virtual enviornment, 
please list what versions of the packages  are installed and available in your PATH at the time of 
running the code). We will try to respond and help.
